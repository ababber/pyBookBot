# pyBookBot

* A `boot.dev` guided project.
* features added beyond scope of project:
  * `pyBookBot` generates reports for more than one book.
  * `pyBookBot` checks if a `books/` directory exists, it gets all the books in that directory, and checks if they are `.txt` files before generating a report.
  * added unit tests to `pyBookBot`
    * tests can be run in a `shell` via `./test.sh`
    * depends on `pytest` as the test runner
